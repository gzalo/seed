# seed
Repository with random riddles for a SeedPirates alternative

# Ideas

It should contain more interactive and different type of riddles (compared to the ones used in seed pirates).
Maybe they could be sequential instead of parallel? Or you could start "revealing"

# UI

Full screen, using a layout similar to what Mel designed for my new website (primary colors).

On top, it should show a Portal style sign with "1/N" and related dangers/rewards:

![Portal 2 signs](inspirations/portal.jpg)

## Entry point

The entry point shall be `seed.gzalo.com`

Will show an animated gif with multiple 4-letter names changing from one into another
For example, using codified "aqui, pone, tuuu, nomb, reen, codi, gonz". + ".gzalo.com"
(2/3 fps so that it can't be copied easily)

And below it should have a message saying: `Para comenzar el juego, codifica las primeras 4 letras de mi nombre`, with a picture of a Caesar Salad and a "+1" symbol.

Answer: "gonz" => "hpoa"
