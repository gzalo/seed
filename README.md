# seed
Repository with random riddles for DBSP's amusement

# Ideas

It should contain more interactive and different type of riddles (compared to seed pirates ones).
Sequential 

# Reward

Steam gift: "Reversion" (3 chapters?), a graphical adventure that happens inside FIUBA 

# UI

Full screen, using a layout similar to what Mel designed for my new website (primary colors).

On top, it should show a Portal style sign with "1/N" and related dangers/rewards:

![Portal 2 signs](inspirations/portal.jpg)

## Entry point

The entry point shall be `seed.gzalo.com`

Will show an animated gif with multiple 4-letter names changing from one into another
For example, using codified "aqui, pone, tuuu, nomb, reen, codi, gonz". + ".gzalo.com"
(2/3 fps so that it can't be copied easily)

And below it should have a message saying: `Para comenzar el juego, codifica las primeras 4 letras de tu nombre`, with a picture of a Caesar Salad and a "+1" symbol.
